            <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
                Learn what React is all about on our <a href="https://reactjs.org/">homepage</a>. 
                People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. 
                Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful. 
                If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our practical tutorial. 
                If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to main concepts.
                Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.

            <p>It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.

            <p>Note that all aria-* HTML attributes are fully supported in JSX. Whereas most DOM properties and attributes in React are camelCased, these attributes should be hyphen-cased (also known as kebab-case, lisp-case, etc) as they are in plain HTML:</p>

            <h1>Testing</h1>
            <p><strong>Set Up/Tear Down</strong></p> 
            <p>This setup assumes you are using <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. For each test, we usually want to render our React tree to a DOM element that’s attached to document. 
                This is important so that it can receive DOM events. 
                When the test ends, we want to “clean up” and unmount the tree from the document.
                A common way to do it is to use a pair of beforeEach and afterEach blocks so that they’ll always run and isolate the effects of a test to itself:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import { unmountComponentAtNode } from "react-dom";
    
                    let container = null;
                    beforeEach(() =&gt; {
                        // setup a DOM element as a render target
                        container = document.createElement("div");
                        document.body.appendChild(container);
                    });
                    
                    afterEach(() =&gt; {
                        // cleanup on exiting
                        unmountComponentAtNode(container);
                        container.remove();
                        container = null;
                    });
                </code>
